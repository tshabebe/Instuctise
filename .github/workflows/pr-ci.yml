  # The step above creates a new Neon branch.
  # You may want to do something with the new branch, such as run migrations, run tests
  # on it, or send the connection details to a hosting platform environment.
  # The branch DATABASE_URL is available to you via:
  # "${{ steps.create_neon_branch.outputs.db_url_with_pooler }}".
  # It's important you don't log the DATABASE_URL as output as it contains a username and
  # password for your database.
  # For example, you can uncomment the lines below to run a database migration command:
  #      - name: Run Migrations
  #        run: npm run db:migrate
  #        env:
  #          # to use pooled connection
  #          DATABASE_URL: "${{ steps.create_neon_branch.outputs.db_url_with_pooler }}"
  #          # OR to use unpooled connection
  #          # DATABASE_URL: "${{ steps.create_neon_branch.outputs.db_url }}"

  # Following the step above, which runs database migrations, you may want to check
  # for schema changes in your database. We recommend using the following action to
  # post a comment to your pull request with the schema diff. For this action to work,
  # you also need to give permissions to the workflow job to be able to post comments
  # and read your repository contents. Add the following permissions to the workflow job:
  #
  # permissions:
  #   contents: read
  #   pull-requests: write
  #
  # You can also check out https://github.com/neondatabase/schema-diff-action for more
  # information on how to use the schema diff action.
  # You can uncomment the lines below to enable the schema diff action.
